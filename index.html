         <p class="funParagraph">"These kitty's all (mostly) came from my neighborhood, the majority from under my own front porch! 
            They are the babies of the community cats that live around me, cats that have lived there longer 
            than I have! And even longer than the person I moved in with! We live in one of those downtown Kansas City 
            neighborhoods with the huge oak trees and large sturdy stone homes. Where generations of families have
            lived. That includes the squirrels, the birds, and the cats. Cats can be seen reguarly sunbathing on porches,
            sidewalks, and yards, living their lives. For the most part, they don't belong to anyone and nobody
            belongs to them."&hearts;
